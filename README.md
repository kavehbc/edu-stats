# Edu-Stats

Official academic tracking platforms do not provide APIs to retrieve the relevant statistics such as h-Index, citations, etc.
Edu-Stats is a parser to extract the scholar statistics and can be used/presented on other websites (e.g. the personal/academic websites).
This API can be consumed as an embedded JavaScript, or retrieve the details in JSON format.

This is developed in multiple languages as below:

- [*php*](php/README.md):
  - For more information, open the [*php*](php/README.md) folder. PHP version has a [live demo](https://edu-stats.kaveh.me/demo/).
- [*python*](python/README.md):
  - This is developed as pip package and can be installed. For more information, check the [*python*](python/README.md) folder.

## Supported Profiles

- **Google Scholar**: php, python
- **Scopus**: php
- **Publons**: php
